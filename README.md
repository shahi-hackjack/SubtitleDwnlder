Subtitle Downloader is a script to automate the downloading of the subtitle for any movie or series without the hassle of searching various websites before getting one synced subtitle. Just right click on your movie file and click on Download Subs. And Voila! It's done. So easy, right!!

It is a python script which sends a GET request using urllib2 to SubDB API and stores the subtitle as srt file.
